Implement data validation within the system to ensure that incoming data meets the required formats 
 and standards before processing or storing it
Enforce access control to only a few people, this will help in case of a security breach. 
Object related access 
control: which can avoid modifications if the same bucket used for multiple use cases. 
Using servers in the only locations that are most accessed which can reduce costs and increase accessibility. 
We can also backup past versions using object versioning as a way for audit logs to perform out root cause analysis in case of data 
integrity issues. 
To get latest updates of the csv files, new object creation will trigger the google cloud 
function. 
Authentication credentials can be securely stored in AWS Secrets Manager or Azure Key Vault to make 
things more secure. 
Ensure encryption is enabled and managed properly, and use secure protocols like HTTPS, SSL, 
or TLS 
Data sanitization can be used to avoid injection attacks.
API Gateways can be used for rate limiting and authentication.
Scalable databases : Ensure scaled database so that data integrity is maintained or use out of the box scalable dbs 
like mongodb.
